## About the Project
**ENCRYPTION**

The task is to write a Python Script that will accept a string as a plain text and then the program will encrypt it using the following character substitute:

  **_'a' = *, 'e' = &, 'i' = # , 'o' = + 'u' = !_**

## About the Program
**STEPS**

1. Getting an input from the user is an important pillar in making a function that requires encryption. therefore it is defined in the first lines of the algorithm.
    
    **_Note:_** Define another variable for the encryption as a placeholder.

2. To check if the input has the variables that will be changed into their corresponding symbols, use:
	
    ``for i in range (len(text_input)):``

   **_Note:_** 'text_input' is the variable

3. Following the step above, use the 'if statement' to check if the variable you're looking for is there. If so, this will change the variable to its corresponding symbol.

    **_Note:_** Remember to use 'elif statement' for many variables to check.

4. Print the encrypted output using ``print().``

## Running the Program

1. Input a word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph that needs to be encrypted.

2. The program will give the encrypted version of the input right away.
